# job-search

Scrapes LinkedIn and Indeed four times a day via GitHub Actions for new
postings matching target titles, and emails a digest via Gmail SMTP.

## What it looks for

- **Titles** (each queried separately against each board):
  Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, Solutions Architect,
  Sales Engineer, Forward Deployed Engineer
- **Locations**: San Francisco Bay Area *and* US-Remote (two passes)
- **Recency**: postings from the last 24 hours

Edit `TITLES` and `LOCATIONS` at the top of
[`scraper/main.py`](scraper/main.py) to change what's searched.

## How it works

```
GitHub Actions cron (4x/day)
  -> scraper.main
       -> scraper.linkedin.search(...)   # per title, per location
       -> scraper.indeed.search(...)
       -> dedupe against seen_jobs.json
       -> if any new: notify.send_digest(...)  (Gmail SMTP)
  -> commit updated seen_jobs.json back to the repo
```

State is persisted by committing `seen_jobs.json` back to the default branch,
so the next run's fresh VM knows what it has already reported.

## One-time setup

### 1. Create the repo on GitHub and push this code

```bash
git init -b main
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: job scraper"
# Create an empty private repo on github.com first, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/<you>/job-search.git
git push -u origin main
```

Or with [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/):

```bash
gh repo create job-search --private --source=. --push
```

### 2. Generate a Gmail App Password

The GitHub Secret cannot be your regular Gmail password -- Google blocks
SMTP logins with account passwords. You need an **App Password**, which
requires 2-Step Verification on the account.

1. Enable 2-Step Verification at <https://myaccount.google.com/security>.
2. Go to <https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords>.
3. Create a new password named e.g. `job-search-actions`.
4. Copy the 16-character password shown (you can paste it with or without
   spaces; Gmail accepts both).

### 3. Add the secrets to the repo

In your repo on GitHub: **Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions
-> New repository secret**. Add:

| Secret | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `GMAIL_USER` | your Gmail address |
| `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` | the 16-character App Password from step 2 |
| `NOTIFY_TO` | (optional) where to send alerts; defaults to `GMAIL_USER` |

### 4. Allow the workflow to push commits

The workflow commits `seen_jobs.json` back to the repo, so it needs write
access to contents.

**Settings -> Actions -> General -> Workflow permissions ->
Read and write permissions -> Save.**

The `permissions: contents: write` at the top of the workflow is necessary
but not sufficient; the repo-level setting is a ceiling.

### 5. Trigger a first run

**Actions tab -> job-scraper -> Run workflow -> Run workflow.**

Expect the first run's email to contain many jobs (everything visible is
"new"). Subsequent runs should only email deltas.

## Schedule

Cron `0 6,12,18,0 * * *` (UTC) -> roughly 01:00, 07:00, 13:00, 19:00 ET.
GitHub cron is best-effort and can be delayed 5-15 minutes under load.

To change the cadence, edit the `cron` line in
[`.github/workflows/job-scraper.yml`](.github/workflows/job-scraper.yml).

## Running locally

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
export GMAIL_USER=you@gmail.com
export GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD='xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx'
export NOTIFY_TO=you@gmail.com
python -m scraper.main
```

The scraper will read and write `seen_jobs.json` in the repo root; delete
it to force a "first run" where everything is treated as new.

## Known limitations

- **LinkedIn** rate-limits by IP. Expect occasional empty-result runs or
  HTTP 429/999 from GitHub Actions runner IPs. The scraper logs and
  tolerates these.
- **Indeed** aggressively Cloudflare-challenges datacenter IPs. Many runs
  from GitHub Actions will return zero results. Treat it as a bonus; the
  primary signal is LinkedIn.
- **CSS selectors** on both sites change occasionally. If runs start
  consistently returning zero jobs, check the action logs for
  `"0 cards parsed"` messages and update the selectors in the respective
  module.
- **First run** emails a large digest. Pre-seed `seen_jobs.json` with a
  previous snapshot if you want to avoid this.

## Secrets and permissions model

- Secrets are encrypted at rest by GitHub and scrubbed from log output;
  workflows triggered by forks of public repos do not receive them.
- The workflow's `GITHUB_TOKEN` is ephemeral per-run and scoped by the
  `permissions:` block. We request only `contents: write`.
- Commits authored by the bot use `job-scraper-bot@users.noreply.github.com`
  so they do not count as contributions for any real user and do not link
  to a profile.
